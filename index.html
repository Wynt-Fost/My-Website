          <h3>Design and development</h3>
          <p>I started learning to code because of my passion for computers and wanting to learn what made them tick. Nothing makes me happier after solving an error that fixed a broken issue in code.</p>

          <h3>Skilled Tradesmen - Furniture Refinishing</h3>
          <p> Refinishing wood furntiure is like art. It is kind of like restoring an old art piece to make it look like it had just been painted. It also allows me to come up with creative ways to fix broken parts in the furniture. I know I talk alot about being CREATIVE but thats what its all about right?!
